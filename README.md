this is a single page application project. I wanted to make something very simple for a user to have on their phone. It uses google maps to create a map that goes from the user's current location to whatever exhibit was selected.

It isn't perfect and there was a lot of learning involved. I had a lot of trouble at the end because I am hosting this project on git hub pages. Git hub pages did not like my .gitignore file. I ended up having to pull all the required files, and placing them in a required files folder
